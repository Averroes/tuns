pNet::DNS
---------

Ruby port of perl Net::DNS.

This project is a direct port of perl Net::DNS, version 0.57.
It has tried to stick as closely as possible to the original
perl code, to allow existing perl code to be ported quickly and
easily to Ruby. This project is not intended to be anything more
than a direct port of the perl code. 

The perl test code has also been ported to Ruby, and all runs
successfully. The demo code has also been ported.

No effort has been made to fix bugs in the original perl code -
this port is as close as possible to the perl.

Issues
------

I've still not had a chance to test on IPv6, so the functionality in
tc_inet6.rb is untested.

Nameserver.rb is a port of the perl version - bugs and all.
It's obviously broken, but would not be hard to fix. 
If you need a working version of this code, please contact me.

JRuby does not yet support TCP, although UDP is fully supported.
