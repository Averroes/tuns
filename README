TUNS - a simple IP over DNS tunnel

TUNS is a prototype implementation of an IP over DNS tunnel. It is provided
here in the interest of reproducibility of scientific results, so that
evaluations that were carried out can be reproduced by others.

Its main features are:
- simplicity: it's thought to be as simple as possible.
  + no complex DNS stuff (TXT records, EDNS0, ...) ; uses only CNAME records
  + no splitting of IP packets: sets the MTU and forgets about it
- efficiency
  + it's optimized for low latency

Usage
-----
You need to delegate two DNS zones (using NS records) to the system where TUNS
will run. One of them will be used to send packets, and the other one will be
used to receive packets. In the following example, we use up.tuns.net and
do.tuns.net.

Client: as root, run tuns-client -s up.tuns.net -r do.tuns.net
Server: as root, run tuns-server -s do.tuns.net -r up.tuns.net

By default, the client runs in verbose mode. Use the -q option to run in
quiet mode.

There's a number of possible options you can use to change default values.
See tuns-client -h and tuns-server -h
